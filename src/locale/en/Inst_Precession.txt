<c>Precession

The actual implementation of the cyclic control is more complex than shown in this demonstrator.

The spinning main rotor of a helicopter acts like a gyroscope.
 
Gyroscopic precession is the resultant action or deflection of a spinning object when a force is applied to this object.
 
This action occurs approximately 90Â° later in the direction of rotation from the point where the force is applied.

This means that in reality the cyclic controls have to apply force 90 degrees ahead of the desired action.
