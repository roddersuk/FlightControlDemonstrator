<c>The COLLECTIVE PITCH control

As the COLLECTIVE PITCH control is raised it increases the pitch or angle of attack of the main rotor blades.

This increases the lift generated by the main rotor until this is sufficient to raise the helicopter off the ground.

It is called the COLLECTIVE PITCH control because the pitch of all of the rotor blades are increased collectively i.e. by the same amount.
