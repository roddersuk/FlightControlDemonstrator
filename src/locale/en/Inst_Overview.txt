<c>Overview

There are three principal flight controls in a helicopter:

The joystick in front of you makes the helicopter go forwards, backwards and sideways and is known as the CYCLIC PITCH control.

The lever down to your left makes the helicopter go up and down and is known as the COLLECTIVE PITCH control.

The foot pedals make the helicopter spin left or right and are known as the ANTI-TORQUE pedals.

This demonstrator is simplified to aid understanding and does not include the effects of Precession.
