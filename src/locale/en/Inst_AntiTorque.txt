<c>The ANTI-TORQUE pedals

The rotation of the main rotor blades would generate an equal and opposite force causing the helicopter body to rotate in the opposite direction if this were not counteracted.

In most helicopters, this force (or TORQUE), is opposed by the tail rotor.

The ANTI-TORQUE pedals alter the pitch of the tail rotor blades allowing this opposing force to be controlled, enabling the helicopter to spin to the left or right.
