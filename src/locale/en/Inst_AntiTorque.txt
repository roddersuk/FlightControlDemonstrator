<c>The ANTI-TORQUE pedals

The rotation of the main rotor blades generates an equal and opposite force (Newton's 3rd Law of Motion) causing the helicopter body to rotate in the opposite direction if this were not counteracted.

In most helicopters, this force (or TORQUE), is opposed by the thrust generated by the tail rotor.

The ANTI-TORQUE pedals alter the pitch of the tail rotor blades allowing this opposing force to be controlled, enabling the helicopter to rotate to the left or right.
