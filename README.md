# FlightControlDemonstrator
Code for a rig to demonstrate helicopter flight controls.

The rig uses a Raspberry Pi Zero with a custom interface to connect to the flight controls on a helicopter rig. It is intended as an interactive display for the Helicopter Museum in Weston-super-Mare. The software will demonstrate the rudiments of operation of the flight controls on a helicopter and will include a simple simulator allowing the user to use the real flight controls to operate the simulation.
